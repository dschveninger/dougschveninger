# Notes on Future Enhancement

I try to spend 2 hours a week to improve or work on the different
repositories on general improvements.  I use this file to track future
todo items in this repository.

1. Continue to fine tune cspell to check comments and not language
2. Improve insall script to support may platforms amc, window and linux (apt-get)
3. Add Pandoc to Makefile to convert Markdown file to PDF.
