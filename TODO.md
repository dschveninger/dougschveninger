# Notes on Future Enhancement

I try to spend 2 hours a week to improve or work on the different
repos on general improvements.  I use this file to track future
todo items in this repo.

1. Add Pandoc to Makefile to convert markdown file to pdf.
1. Add Markdown Linting as a Make target
1. Add GitHub event to run quality checks.
