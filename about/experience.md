# EXPERIENCE

## AT&T Services Inc., St. Louis, Missouri

### Lead System Engineer, 5/19 – 8/2021

Enabled the Network Cloud program testing culture to change from 4 different teams,
each with their own testing methods, to a shared quality automation framework,
based on a standard interface, reporting, and evaluation tool-set. This allowed development,
testing, lab, and operational support teams to work together to find defects as soon as
possible in CICD pipelines.  Created test suites based on the above automation framework
that uses data from two system services to project as test cases instead of coding for the
requirements twice.  The first service is Gatekeeper Open Policy Agent (OPA) which provide
Kubernetes Custom Resources constraints that are monitored over time and the policies and
violations are turned into test cases.  The second service is the Logging, Monitoring and
Alerting (LMA) stack where Prometheus rules and alerts are converted into test cases.
Also working with the Security team to move their scanning tools to the left so CIS
benchmarks and image Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) violations can be found
during the packaging process instead of the deployment process.

### Principal System Engineer and Lead Developer, 10/15 – 5/19

Transferred to the AT&T Integrated Cloud team to bring my Development and Agile process
experience to the OpenStack Cloud DevOps organization. Started out as a delivery team
member on a core OpenStack Team and became the Lead Developer for the FullCD automated
deployment team.  As the Lead Developer I helped architect the Automated Quality Assurance
frameworks for API, GUI, CLI and Resource testing while supporting OpenStack Jenkins and
Ansible deployment pipeline.

### Principal Technical Architect, 05/12 – 10/15

Helped transform a team, based on extreme programming principles, to be one of the first
Gold Level Agile programming teams with a well-defined continuous integration environment.
Within a two week iteration cycle, we increased the capabilities of the system to simulate
interfaces transaction from 1,200 TPS to 6,000 TPS and supported HTTP RESTful interfaces.
Throughput increases were achieved by restructuring database access and increasing caching
of key data elements.  RESTful interfaces were supported using Jersey framework.  Acted as
Product Owner of the infrastructure team to improve the ability of the team to support the
application as tier one support and improve the relationship between development team.
Acted as Product Owner Delegate of the development team in order to help the Product Owner
manage the backlog and define priorities.

### Senior Technical Architect and Server-Side Team Lead, 05/08 – 04/12

Helped to grow a team from 3 to 12 members, while increasing the system’s features and
ability to support performance testing.  The system provided interface reference information,
client-side testing and server-side simulations.  Worked with presentation Team Leader to
design and communicate the team’s direction according to vision, informal requests and formal
requirements.  Transformed business requirements into formal application design documentation
in order to level set the team's understanding of the release deliverables.  Defined direction
and promoted standards to improve team's overall quality of release deliverables in the areas
of coding standards, testing coverage and documentation.

period, with a 1.4 year return on investment.  The next initiative was the ability to split a
request into multiple ordering systems, in order to streamline the overall ordering process.
This project was done in 9 months with 7 development resources.  Both projects were delivered
on time with the smallest amount of system test defects.  As team leader, I was responsible
for the project plan, high level design, detail design, interface agreements, code quality,
unit and integration test plans.
